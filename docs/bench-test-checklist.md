# Bench Test Checklist

Props OFF for all steps below unless explicitly noted otherwise. This checklist gates every phase in PRD.md — do not skip ahead to flight until every phase's checklist passes.

## Phase 0 — raw link (`raspi/bench_test.py`)

**✅ 2026-07-21 — uplink (Pi→FC) dead-link issue found and resolved; root cause was a damaged FC pin.**
Investigation trail (kept for reference — don't repeat this diagnosis if the link ever goes dead
again, check the resolution first):
1. `/dev/serial0` was mapped to the Bluetooth mini-UART (`ttyS0`) instead of the PL011 UART
   (`ttyAMA0`) — `docs/wiring.md` setup step 2 had never been applied. Fixed (confirmed
   `/dev/serial0 -> ttyAMA0`), but not the root cause: uplink was still dead after this fix.
2. Ruled out (all tested and eliminated): MAVLink2 signing, missing GCS-heartbeat-presence,
   MAVLink1-vs-2 wire format, wiring/pinout per docs (multimeter continuity), SBUS-pin-inversion
   sharing.
3. Moved to UART3 (R3/T3) as an experiment — dead silence (zero bytes), but this was a red herring:
   `SERIAL3_PROTOCOL` was still at its factory default (5 = GPS), not MAVLink. Confirmed via direct
   USB connection to the FC (`SERIAL2_PROTOCOL=2`/`SERIAL2_BAUD=57` already correct, matching
   `drone.param`; full 1111-param diff against `drone.param` showed **zero differences** — params
   were never the problem).
4. Root cause found via voltage measurement with the FC back on UART2 and powered: **R2 reads
   2.6V to GND, where T2, R3, and T3 all read a clean 3.3V idle-high.** A Pi-side TX/RX loopback
   test (GPIO14 jumpered to GPIO15) passed perfectly, ruling out the Pi entirely. Conclusion: the
   FC's R2 pin is electrically damaged (multi-megohm leakage to ground) — not a wiring, baud, or
   config issue.
5. **Fix:** moved the physical link to UART3 (R3/T3), set `SERIAL3_PROTOCOL=2`/`SERIAL3_BAUD=57`
   over USB (bypassing the chicken-and-egg problem of needing a working uplink to configure the
   port that provides the uplink). Re-tested `PARAM_REQUEST_READ` from the Pi over the new UART3
   link — got a real `PARAM_VALUE` response, repeatably. **Uplink confirmed working.**
   `docs/wiring.md` and `firmware-config/drone.param` updated to UART3/`SERIAL3_*`. Do not rewire
   back to UART2/R2 without re-checking that 2.6V reading first.

- [x] FC parameters loaded from `firmware-config/drone.param`, reviewed against actual FC (baud, fence radius/alt for your site). (2026-07-21: confirmed via full param diff over USB, FC matches `drone.param` exactly, 1111/1111 params, no differences.)
- [x] Wiring per `docs/wiring.md` confirmed with a multimeter continuity check before power-on. (2026-07-21: UART3/R3-T3 wiring confirmed; see root-cause note above for the R2/UART2 story.)
- [x] `python3 raspi/bench_test.py --port /dev/serial0 --baud 57600` connects, prints heartbeat from FC. (2026-07-20: confirmed, heartbeat `{type: 2, autopilot: 3, ...}` received.)
- [x] Telemetry (`GPS_RAW_INT`, `SYS_STATUS`, `VFR_HUD`) visible in script output. (2026-07-21: confirmed over UART3 with an explicit `REQUEST_DATA_STREAM` — 14x `GPS_RAW_INT`, 14x `SYS_STATUS`, 15x `VFR_HUD` in 8s. `GPS_RAW_INT.fix_type=0`/`satellites_visible=0` is now known to be a genuine no-fix indoors, not a missing-stream artifact, since the stream is confirmed flowing.)
- [x] Arm refused while GPS fix_type < 3 (script default behavior) — confirm the refusal path actually triggers by testing indoors/no-fix. (2026-07-20: confirmed, `Refusing to arm: GPS fix_type=0 (< 3D fix)` — see telemetry caveat above on whether this is a real no-fix or a missing stream.)
- [x] Arm succeeds (command-path testing, motors disconnected/props off).
  - **2026-07-21: root cause found — this airframe has no GPS module at all** (never wired, confirmed by the user; not a wiring/config bug). Outdoor test showed `SYS_STATUS` GPS sensor bit `present=False` and `sats=0` throughout. Accelerometer calibration (QGroundControl, USB) resolved `3D Accel calibration needed`. Removed the now-obsolete app-layer/bridge-layer GPS-fix arm gates in `server.py`/`mavlink_bridge.py` (see `CLAUDE.md`); `bench_test.py --force-arm` still bypasses its own standalone gate the same way as before.
  - FC-side changes applied via QGroundControl (USB, battery disconnected each time): `ARMING_CHECK` relaxed to exclude RC + GPS-lock (+ compass, since it was still reporting unhealthy with no module); `FS_GCS_ENABLE=3` (Land, not RTL); `FENCE_TYPE=1` (altitude-only).
  - Hit two more blockers along the way, both resolved: (1) `Logging failed`/`Logging not started` — the SD card slot was empty; inserting a card wasn't enough on its own (SD is only detected at FC boot, needed a power cycle), and the card also had no partition/filesystem at all (`lsblk`/`blkid` showed nothing) — reformatted as MBR + single FAT32 partition (`ARDULOG` label) from the laptop, reinserted, rebooted FC, logging check cleared. (2) `Radio Failsafe - Disarming` immediately after a successful arm — `FS_THR_ENABLE` (RC/throttle failsafe, distinct from `FS_GCS_ENABLE`) was still at its factory default and expects RC signal that will never exist on this airframe; set to `0` via QGC, documented in `firmware-config/drone.param`. `FS_GCS_ENABLE` remains the sole/intended failsafe.
  - 2026-07-21: `bench_test.py --port /dev/serial0 --baud 57600 --force-arm --test-manual-control` ran clean end to end — arm accepted, 3s neutral `MANUAL_CONTROL` at 30Hz with no rejection/disconnect, disarm accepted.
- [x] `--test-manual-control` sends neutral MANUAL_CONTROL for 3s without FC rejecting/disconnecting. (2026-07-21: confirmed, see above.)
- [x] Disarm succeeds. (2026-07-21: confirmed, see above — also separately observed the FC auto-disarm on its own a few seconds after a test script exited and heartbeats stopped, consistent with `FS_GCS_ENABLE` Land + landed-disarm behavior.)
- [ ] **Failsafe drill (non-negotiable):** with script running and armed (props off), kill the script (Ctrl+C) or pull Raspi WiFi power. Confirm via a separate GCS (Mission Planner / QGroundControl on another device connected to the FC, or FC status LED pattern) that **Land** triggers within `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT` seconds (not RTL — no GPS home position exists on this airframe). Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this is confirmed.
  - **2026-07-21: ran on the bench (props off, stationary, armed via SSH), partial/inconclusive result.** Timing was right — armed went `True`→`False` at t=5.8s, matching `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT=5`. But flight mode stayed `STABILIZE` throughout; it never switched to `LAND`. Read: ArduCopter's landed-detector most likely short-circuited the failsafe straight to a disarm, since the vehicle was stationary at zero throttle the whole time — switching to `LAND` mode is probably suppressed as pointless when already on the ground. This is a safe outcome for a ground test but does **not** confirm the actual in-flight behavior (`LAND` engaging and executing a controlled descent), which can only be observed while the FC believes it's airborne.
  - Separately, **no FC LED or buzzer change was observed** at the failsafe moment, despite telemetry (via the same Pi/UART link) clearly showing the disarm at t=5.8s. This matters: if the real-world failure is "Pi crashes/loses power entirely" rather than "script gets killed," that same telemetry channel is gone too — the FC's own physical indicators would be the only signal available in the field, and today we don't know if this board gives one reliably. Watch closely for any LED/buzzer change during the outdoor repeat.
  - Deferred to the outdoor low-altitude hover repeat (see "Outdoor pre-flight repeat" below) per user decision 2026-07-21 — do not mark this box done until Land-engagement and the LED/buzzer question are both actually confirmed there, with a spotter present.

**2026-07-23 — `firmware-config/drone.param` synced with the live FC (was drifted).** The FC-side
changes applied via QGroundControl on 2026-07-21 (see arm-succeeds entry above) had never been
written back to the checked-in param file — reloading it onto a reset FC would have silently
reintroduced RTL-without-GPS and full arming checks. Read the actual live values directly over
MAVLink (`PARAM_REQUEST_READ`) rather than guess, and corrected the file:
- `FS_GCS_ENABLE`: file said `1` (RTL), live FC has `5` (Land). (Checklist prose above says the
  applied value was "3" — that was a recording mistake; 5 is what's actually on the FC and is the
  correct value: Land, not RTL, since there's no GPS. Note the discrepancy in case "3" is ever
  quoted elsewhere.)
- `ARMING_CHECK`: file said `1` (all checks), live FC has `9650` (excludes RC/GPS-lock/Compass,
  per the arm-succeeds entry above). Documented the exact bitmask in `drone.param` now.
- `FENCE_TYPE`: file said `7` (alt+circle+polygon), live FC has `1` (altitude-only, matching
  CLAUDE.md's no-GPS constraint).

**✅ 2026-07-23 — uneven motor spin-up / backward flip on slow throttle-up; root cause was uncalibrated ESCs, fixed via ESC_CALIBRATION.**
Symptom: ramping throttle up slowly (originally via the joystick, later via the new fine-thrust
slider in `web/app.js`/`index.html` added the same session — 0-15% range, beside the throttle
stick) produced uneven motor spin and the drone flipping backward; later described more precisely
as "nothing happens for the first ~15%, then all motors lurch hard."
1. Read the live FC params directly over MAVLink (`PARAM_REQUEST_READ`, service stopped briefly to
   get exclusive UART3 access): `FRAME_CLASS`/`FRAME_TYPE` correct (1/1, quad X); `MOT_PWM_MIN/MAX`
   (1000/2000), `MOT_SPIN_ARM` (0.10), `MOT_SPIN_MIN` (0.15), `MOT_SPIN_MAX` (0.95),
   `MOT_THST_EXPO`/`MOT_THST_HOVER` all still at stock ArduCopter factory defaults — nothing
   actually misconfigured there. But `ESC_CALIBRATION = 0`: the ESCs had never been calibrated to
   this FC's PWM range at all, confirmed by the user ("I could not do any ESC calibration so far").
   Each ESC's own idea of min/max PWM was still whatever it shipped with — explains both the uneven
   per-motor response and the flip (asymmetric thrust as different ESCs cross their own thresholds
   at different points).
2. This airframe has **no RC receiver at all** (MAVLink-only control from the Pi), so the normal
   throttle-stick-based ESC calibration method doesn't apply. Used `ESC_CALIBRATION = 3`
   ("automatic, no throttle stick needed" per ArduPilot docs) instead: set via `param_set_send`
   (harmless by itself — doesn't move any output), then the user power-cycled the battery (not a
   reboot command — the calibration entry check only runs at power-on).
3. **First power-cycle attempt was ambiguous** — user heard "ascending and descending" tones but no
   motor movement, and the FC then went completely silent on the link afterward (a raw pyserial
   read got zero bytes over a 4s window, not just no MAVLink heartbeat). This matches ArduPilot's
   documented behavior: after the calibration routine finishes (PWM to max ~5s, then to min), it
   **blocks indefinitely awaiting another reboot** — so the silence was expected, not a fault.
   Confirmed the caveat flagged going in still stands unverified either way: `esc_calibration_startup_check()`
   also runs an internal RC-radio calibration check first, and it's undocumented whether that
   silently skips calibration on a board with zero RC receiver hardware — the first tone sequence
   heard could have been either the real calibration tune or just the normal boot tune plus an
   unrelated tone; inconclusive from audio alone.
4. **Second power-cycle** (per ArduPilot docs, required after calibration completes) brought the
   link back immediately; `ESC_CALIBRATION` read back as `0` (auto-reset by the FC on successful
   completion, confirming calibration DID run and finish). Startup tone this time was the user's
   familiar normal boot tune, consistent with `ESC_CALIBRATION` already being back at 0.
5. **Confirmed fixed**, user's words: "Now it works perfectly, when arming, motors begin to rotate
   decent and with the control, I can safely/smoothly increase the thrust as expected." Bench
   check only so far (props on presumably still pending a real hover test) — do not skip the
   low-altitude hover confirmation before treating this as flight-ready.
6. **Motor order/rotation direction independently confirmed, props still off**, via
   `MAV_CMD_DO_MOTOR_TEST` (4x sequential, 10% throttle, 2s each, service stopped briefly for
   exclusive UART3 access) — all four motors ACK'd `ACCEPTED` and spun in sequence 1→2→3→4.
   User confirmed all four spin in the direction matching their mounted props. This closes out the
   other candidate root cause raised alongside ESC calibration at the start of this investigation
   (motor order/`FRAME_TYPE` mapping was fine all along; ESC calibration was the actual fix).
   Props remounted after this check.

- [x] ESC calibration performed (`ESC_CALIBRATION=3`, no-RC-receiver method) and confirmed working
  via smooth/even motor response on slow throttle ramp-up. (2026-07-23, see root-cause note above.)
- [x] Motor order/rotation direction confirmed correct for `FRAME_TYPE` (X) via props-off
  `MAV_CMD_DO_MOTOR_TEST`, all 4 motors. (2026-07-23, see root-cause note above.)

## Phase 1 — backend service (`raspi/server.py`)

- [x] `pip install -r raspi/requirements.txt` on the Raspi. (2026-07-23: Raspi OS is now Bookworm,
  which blocks system-wide pip installs — needed a venv, `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` updated.
  `requirements.txt` was also missing `pyserial`, a hard dependency of pymavlink's serial backend —
  without it the bridge thread crashed on startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'serial'`. Fixed; installed clean.)
- [ ] AP up: `raspi/ap-setup/install.sh` run once, `hostapd.conf` passphrase changed from default, AP visible from a phone/laptop, DHCP lease obtained. (Not attempted this session — remote/SSH only, no phone in hand.)
- [x] `FC_PORT=/dev/serial0 FC_BAUD=57600 uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` (from `raspi/`) starts without error, connects to FC. (2026-07-23: confirmed after the `pyserial` fix above. Also found `raspi/sync-to-pi.sh` only ever synced `raspi/` — `server.py` expects `web/` as a sibling directory and would fail `StaticFiles` mount without it. Fixed to sync both.)
- [x] From a WS client, send `{"type":"arm"}` / `{"type":"disarm"}` / `{"type":"control",...}` and confirm FC responds with props off. (2026-07-23: exercised over a plain Python `websockets` script, not a browser — arm/disarm/mode/control messages all accepted with no server errors, and telemetry's `armed` field reflected disarm correctly. **Did not visually/audibly confirm props-off arm behavior (motor beep) — no one was physically present at the airframe during this remote session.** Treat this box as protocol-level only; do a hands-on repeat before trusting it fully.)
- [x] Telemetry JSON streams back over the same socket at a reasonable rate. (2026-07-23: initially `battery_voltage`/`alt` came back `null` even with the FC connected — root cause: the bridge never sent `REQUEST_DATA_STREAM`, so the FC only ever pushed unsolicited `HEARTBEAT`. Added an explicit `REQUEST_DATA_STREAM` request (`MAV_DATA_STREAM_ALL` @ 4Hz) to both `mavlink_bridge.py` and `bench_test.py`. After the fix, confirmed live: `battery_voltage=24.05`, `battery_remaining=78%`, `alt≈0`, `gps_fix_type=0`/`satellites_visible=0` (expected, no GPS module).)
- [x] Repeat the Phase 0 failsafe drill through the service: kill `server.py` (or the whole Pi's WiFi), confirm FC-side RTL/Land within `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT`.
  - **2026-07-23: ran remotely over SSH (props off, stationary, armed via a WS client hitting `server.py`).** Sequence: WS client sent `{"type":"arm"}`, confirmed `armed=true` in the telemetry stream, then within ~0.4s issued `kill -9` on the `uvicorn` process (PID-targeted, not `pkill -f` — an earlier attempt using `pkill -f 'uvicorn server:app'` silently failed because the pattern also matches the SSH-invoked shell's own command line that contains that same string, killing/racing the wrong thing) while a second, purely receive-only MAVLink connection (never transmits its own heartbeat, so it can't itself satisfy `FS_GCS_ENABLE`) attached directly to `/dev/serial0` to observe the FC independently of the now-dead service.
  - Result: `armed` flipped `True`→`False` at ~5s after heartbeat loss (consistent with `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT=5`), matching the Phase 0 timing result. **Mode stayed `ALT_HOLD` throughout — never switched to `LAND`**, same as the Phase 0 finding: the vehicle was stationary at zero throttle, and ArduCopter's landed-detector most likely short-circuits straight to disarm rather than engaging `LAND` when already on the ground. This is a safe outcome but still does not confirm real in-flight `LAND` engagement — that remains gated on the outdoor repeat (see below and `docs/failsafe-drill.md`).
  - Service was restarted afterward and confirmed reconnected to the FC cleanly (`armed=false`, telemetry flowing) — left running in a normal state.
  - Still not confirmed by this test: FC LED/buzzer behavior at the failsafe moment (no one physically present), and true `LAND` mode engagement while airborne. Both remain deferred to the outdoor pre-flight repeat.

## Phase 2/3 — full stack via PWA

**2026-07-23 — mode dropdown offered GPS-dependent modes on a no-GPS airframe.** `web/index.html`'s
`#mode-select` listed LOITER/GUIDED/RTL alongside STABILIZE/ALT_HOLD/LAND — the first three all need
a position estimate per CLAUDE.md, which this airframe cannot produce. Removed; dropdown now only
offers STABILIZE/ALT_HOLD/LAND. Bumped the service worker's `CACHE_NAME` so a browser that already
cached the old shell picks up the fix on next load instead of serving stale HTML.

**2026-07-23 — ran the checklist below over the existing home WiFi (not the dedicated AP — AP setup
still pending, see Phase 1) using an automated Chrome session (`claude-in-chrome`) driving the real
PWA at `http://192.168.2.152:8000/`, since no phone/tablet was in hand this session.** Findings:

- [x] Loaded `http://192.168.2.152:8000/`. Status bar showed CONNECTED, HUD populated correctly
  (armed, mode, battery, GPS fix=0/sats=0, alt) immediately on load.
- [x] Virtual joysticks. Automated mouse drag (`left_click_drag`) did **not** move the knob — the
  canvas listens for Pointer Events, not plain mouse events, and Chrome's synthetic mouse-drag
  didn't produce them. Verified the actual logic instead by dispatching real `PointerEvent`s via JS
  (equivalent to what a touchscreen sends): left stick — dragging up-right then releasing left
  yaw (`x`) snap to 0 while throttle (`y`) held at its dragged value; right stick — dragging then
  releasing snapped **both** roll and pitch to 0. Matches the intended per-axis self-centering
  exactly (`initialY:1, selfCenterY:false` on the left stick for throttle-holds; both centering on
  the right stick). Note: a bare `pointerdown` with no follow-up `pointermove` throws
  `NotFoundError` from `canvas.setPointerCapture` in `joystick.js:26` (no real capture session
  behind a synthetic event) — harmless for genuine touch input (which always has a live capture
  session) but left 4 exceptions in the console from this test session; not a shippable bug.
- [ ] Physical gamepad — **not tested**, no hardware gamepad available in this automated session.
  Needs a hands-on pass with a real controller.
- [x] ARM/DISARM buttons and mode dropdown, clicked for real in the browser (not just over raw WS
  as in earlier phases). Both round-tripped correctly through the FC — HUD flipped to `ARMED`/
  `disarmed`, and switching the mode dropdown to STABILIZE was confirmed reflected back in the HUD's
  `Mode` field a moment later. Dropdown correctly offers only STABILIZE/ALT_HOLD/LAND per the
  2026-07-23 GPS-mode fix above.
- [x] Latency: click-to-HUD-update was consistently sub-second (~0.3–1s) over the home LAN; felt
  responsive. Not measured over the dedicated AP yet (pending AP setup) or with a real touchscreen,
  but no reason to expect materially different results on the same local network.
- [x] Full-stack failsafe drill via the actual PWA. Non-trivial to time correctly: ArduCopter's own
  zero-throttle ground auto-disarm fires within a couple of seconds of arming (independent of any
  failsafe, unrelated to `FS_GCS_ENABLE`), which is faster than a human/manual UI-click-then-kill
  reaction time in this session — several early attempts ended up killing the server *after* the
  vehicle had already disarmed on its own, which would have produced a false-looking pass. Worked
  around by having the page itself await the `armed:true` telemetry message before triggering the
  kill (sub-300ms round trip), then killing `server.py` (`kill -9`, simulating a crash) immediately.
  Result: PWA's status bar correctly flipped to `DISCONNECTED` within ~1s and the HUD froze on its
  last known state (`ARMED`) rather than updating — expected, since no more telemetry arrives once
  the socket is dead; the prominent top status bar (not the frozen HUD fields) is the trustworthy
  disconnect signal, consistent with the PRD's "prominent connection-status indicator" intent. A
  passive, receive-only second MAVLink connection (attached directly to `/dev/serial0`, never
  transmits its own heartbeat) confirmed the FC-side disarm again, timing consistent with
  `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT=5` — same result and same LAND-mode-never-engages caveat as the Phase 0/1 drills
  (stationary/zero-throttle likely short-circuits straight to disarm rather than entering LAND).
  **Real LAND engagement still unconfirmed — deferred to the outdoor repeat, as before.**
- **Bug found (not yet fixed): reconnect race can leave the status bar stuck on `DISCONNECTED`.**
  After several rapid kill/restart cycles in this session, the page's status bar showed
  `DISCONNECTED` while `ws.readyState` was actually `1` (OPEN) and telemetry was demonstrably
  flowing (battery % updating, `link-text` correctly showing "FC link OK"). Root cause: `connect()`
  in `web/app.js` has no guard against overlapping reconnect attempts — a stale WebSocket object's
  late-firing `onclose` can overwrite the status bar set by a newer, already-successful `onopen`.
  A full page reload immediately fixed it. This is exactly the gap already called out in
  `PRD.md` Phase 4 ("a `connecting` guard against overlapping timers") — now confirmed as a real,
  reproducible issue rather than a theoretical one. Not fixed as part of this pass; see PRD Phase 4
  ordering. Practical impact: only surfaces after multiple link drops/restarts within one page
  session (e.g. repeated WiFi flakiness without a reload) — the *first* disconnect in a session
  always renders correctly.

## Phase 4 — safety & reliability hardening

- [x] `raspi/drone-control.service` (systemd unit) installed and enabled on the Pi
  (`/etc/systemd/system/drone-control.service`, `systemctl enable`d). Replaces the manual
  `uvicorn ...` run from the README.
- [x] Auto-restart-vs-`FS_GCS_TIMEOUT` masking risk bench-tested — see `docs/failsafe-drill.md`
  ("systemd auto-restart interaction"). 2026-07-23: `SIGKILL`ed the service mid-arm (props off);
  restart took 6.54s to HTTP, longer to MAVLink-reconnect, both past `FS_GCS_TIMEOUT=5s` — FC had
  already failed safe (`armed:false`) by the time the service recovered. Not a masking risk on this
  hardware as currently configured; do not shorten `RestartSec` without re-testing.
- [x] Geofence app-level handling (fence-breach telemetry field + HUD banner). 2026-07-23:
  `mavlink_bridge.py` parses `FENCE_STATUS.breach_status` into a `fence_breached` telemetry field,
  surfaced in the WS schema (`server.py`) and rendered as `#fence-banner` in `web/index.html`/
  `app.js`. Implemented same session as the rest of Phase 4 but missed in this checklist at the
  time — confirmed present via code inspection 2026-07-23, not yet exercised live (no way to trigger
  a real fence breach on the bench); do a live confirm outdoors once `FENCE_RADIUS`/`FENCE_ALT_MAX`
  are set for the actual site.
- [x] WS reconnect/retry hardening (exponential backoff, overlapping-timer guard, retry-state
  indicator). 2026-07-23: `web/app.js` now backs off 1s→2s→4s→8s (capped 10s) via
  `RECONNECT_BASE_MS`/`RECONNECT_MAX_MS`, guards against overlapping timers with `reconnectTimer`,
  and shows a `retrying in Ns (attempt N)` status-bar message — fixes the reconnect-race bug found
  in the Phase 2/3 section above. Confirmed present via code inspection 2026-07-23; not yet
  re-run through the actual kill/restart-cycle repro from Phase 2/3.
- [x] Battery failsafe surfaced in-app (`BATT_MONITOR`/`BATT_LOW_VOLT`/`BATT_CRT_VOLT` +
  matching HUD banner). Airframe confirmed 6S LiPo (22.2V nominal) 2026-07-23. `drone.param` sets
  `BATT_LOW_VOLT=21.0`/`BATT_CRT_VOLT=19.8` (3.5V/cell, 3.3V/cell) with `BATT_FS_LOW_ACT`/
  `BATT_FS_CRT_ACT=1` (Land, not RTL — no GPS). `mavlink_bridge.py` mirrors the same two thresholds
  to compute `battery_status` (normal/low/critical) from `SYS_STATUS`; `app.js` colors the battery
  readout and shows `#battery-banner` accordingly. Confirmed present via code inspection 2026-07-23;
  live low/critical thresholds not yet exercised against a real battery in that voltage range.

## Before first real flight

- [ ] All boxes above checked, on the actual airframe, at the actual flight site.
- [ ] Outdoor failsafe drill repeated per `docs/failsafe-drill.md`, low altitude, spotter ready to catch/land manually.
- [ ] Geofence (`FENCE_*` params) values confirmed correct for the site.
